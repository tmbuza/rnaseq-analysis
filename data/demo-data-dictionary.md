# Demo RNA-seq dataset

 Files:
 - `demo-counts.csv`: gene-level raw counts (rows = genes, columns = samples)
 - `demo-metadata.csv`: sample metadata (`sample_id`, `condition`, `library_size`)
 - `demo-truth.csv`: teaching label indicating which genes were simulated as truly differential

 Notes:
 - This dataset is synthetic and intended for learning and demonstration.
 - Design is balanced: 6 Control and 6 Treatment samples.
